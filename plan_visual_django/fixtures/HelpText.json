The attributes which can be modified in this panel for the currently selected activity are:\r\n        - Swimlane (dropdown)\r\n        - Track (arrows to move up or down within the swimlane)\r\n        - Text Flow (Left aligned flowing to the right, out of the activity if required, Right aligned flowing left, out of the shape if required, or central, flowing out of the shape in both directions if required.\r\n        - Height (arrows to increase or decrease the number of tracks an activity covers)\r\n        - Shape (dropdown - allows the shape to be used to display the activity to be modified)\r\n        - Style (dropdown) - allows the style of the activity to be modified\r\n    - The Timelines Panel lists all the timelines that have been implemented and allows the user to change the order that they appear in the visual and toggle them on or off for the current visual.",

This structure is important as when defining which activities to place on\r\n        the visual, typically you would either place a high level activity or its lower level sub-activities, but\r\n        not both (to make good use of the space available).  This principle will also be adopted by automated\r\n        algorithms for creating visuals.  If level is not included then the app will still work but it will be much more\r\n        difficult to create a good visual as it won't be obvious which activities are sub-\r\n        activities of others.</td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    </tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n\r\nVarious formats are supported (and these will be added to as support for different use cases increases).\r\n\r\nThis screen allows the user to see what the mapping is for each defined type, so that they can check that their exported Excel file conforms to an agreed mapping, or can use to define a mapping for an export.\r\n\r\nThe intention is to minimise the effort expensed by a user in order to use the app so mappings have been chosen to be as near to default or standard export formats for the expected use cases (such as MS Project Excel File Export and SmartSheet File Export).\r\n\r\nFeel free to contact the developer if you'd like to see additional mappings.  In the future it is expected that users with the appropriate level will be able to add their own mappings.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft Project allows the user to export any project plan to Excel and it is easy to ensure that the minimum fields required to support creating a Plan Visualisation are included in the exported file.",
