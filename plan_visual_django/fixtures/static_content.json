      "content": "This is a web application aimed at project managers who face the repetitive task of having to create a one page summary of a project plan in a visually striking format for sharing with project meetings, senior stakeholder reports or other use cases.\r\n\r\n## Why was Plan On One Page written?\r\n\r\nPlan On One Page has a single objective of allowing users, typically project managers, easily to import a project plan and then create a  visualisation of the plan which takes summary or detailed tasks and places them onto a visual in a way which makes good use of space and is nicely formatted.\r\n\r\n## What does Plan On One Page do?\r\n\r\nKey features and reasons to use Plan On One Page:\r\n\r\n- Avoids the painstaking work often taken by project managers in creating (often in PowerPoint) a one page summary of a plan, and then keeping that summary up to date as the plan changes, and also ensuring that tasks are properly aligned and of the right length to represent tasks on the plan and their correct dates.\r\n- Makes it easy to create a summary of a plan which isn't constrained by how the plan is structure in MS Project or whichever app the plan was created in.\r\n- Supports the use of swimlanes to present the plan in a way which is logical for the audience.\r\n- Allows multiple different visualisations of a plan to be created.\r\n- Visualisations are automatically updated when a new version of the plan is available.\r\n- Allows the addition of one or more timelines to the visual in months, quarters, half-years or years.\r\n- Allows styling to be fine tuned, with the option to alter colours, shapes for activities, flow of text in an activity to ensure it doesn't run off the and of the page, for example.\r\n\r\n## How do I use Plan On One Page?\r\n\r\nPlan On One Page has a simple workflow, which is:\r\n\r\n- Export your project plan from MS Project or other app into Excel in one of the supported formats\r\n- Import your project plan in Excel format into Plan On One Page\r\n- Create an initial Plan On One Page from your plan.\r\n- Define what Swimlanes you want on the Plan On One Page\r\n- For each swimlane, define which activities or milestones you want in the Plan On One Page and add  them\r\n- Adjust the position of activities within the swimlane.  Activities can appear on the same line if required which help in making use of the space and helps create a logical format for viewers.  Also the activity names can be made to flow to the left or the right so that they don't interfere with other activities or the end of the visual.\r\n- Add up to four timelines as required\r\n- Adjust colours, shapes as required, for swimlanes, timelines, activities and milestones.\r\n- When the plan changes, reupload and the Plan On One Page will update automatically.\r\n- Create more than one Plan On One Page for any given plan for different purposes"

      "content": "If your project plan has been created in Smartsheet (link to Smartsheet) then it is very easy to export in a format which can be imported into PlanOnOnePage.\r\n\r\nIf your project plan isn't in Smartsheet or MS Project you may be able to import it into Smartsheet and then export it into Excel, which may be an easy workflow.\r\n\r\nSmartsheet supports all the fields required to import and process a plan within the PlanOnOnePage app, but the Id column isn't included by default.  The Id column is required if you want the ability to re-import future versions of a plan and for the app to remember which activities were in any visuals that you had created and adjust them accordingly.\r\n\r\nHowever the Id column can be added very easily, using the following steps\r\n\r\n1. Ensure you are in the GANTT view.\r\n2. Right click on the column to the right of where you would like to insert the Id column.\r\n3. Click on the \"Insert Column Left\" option.\r\n4. A \"New Column\" Dialogue box will be displayed.\r\n5. Enter \"Id\" as the name (note case - this is important).\r\n6. For \"Column Type\" click on the \"# Auto Number\" option.\r\n\r\nThis will assign a number to each row.  Note you may need to save the plan for this column to be updated.  Initially the numbers will be sequential but you will see that if you insert rows between two numbered rows, the number will stick to the original row it was assigned to, and the new row will be allocated one greater than whatever is the highest number which has been allocated.\r\n\r\nThis means that if you update the plan and add new activities between others, the Plan On One Page app will keep track if which activities have been added, deleted or are still present, and adjust any visuals associated with that plan.\r\n\r\nOnce you have added the Id column you can then easily export the plan to Excel with the following steps:\r\n\r\n1. Ensure your plan is open and in the GANTT view\r\n2. From the menu at the top of the app screen select File | Export.\r\n3. In the export sub-menu select the Excel option.\r\n\r\nThe exported file will be downloaded to your default downloads folder (dependent upon your OS and browser)"
