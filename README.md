**Django Web App With One Purpose: Help to easily create a one page summary of a Project Plan**

*Currently In Development*

The app is currently in pre-release mode.  Work is focussed on getting to the point where the first version of the app can be released in a state where it can be promoted.

I would be interested in making contact with potential future customers of the app who can help me to prioritise features and determine when the app is in a position where it can be formally launched.

*Description*

This app will fulfil a single need which, as a Project Manager over many years, I have faced many times.  That is - given a Project Plan for a project which may be complex and difficult to understand, how do I create a one page summary of that plan which I can use for non project stakeholders, or to display a summary view of the plan to the project team

The app has the following broad features:
- Import a project plan which has been exported to Excel from a number of supported applications such as SmartSheets or MS Project
- Easily create a one page visualisation of that plan by offering the following functionality
    - Select which activities from the plan will appear on the visual
    - Define "swimlanes" which the selected activities will appear on the visual
    - Place selected activities within a swimlane
    - Vertically position activities within a swimlane - with the ability to place multiple activities on the same line.
    - Influence how the activity description text flows on the visual (e.g. for activities which are near the left hand side, can make them left justified so they don't overflow.
    - Define formatting for swimlanes, activities, milestones
    - Add timeline labels for Months, Quarters etc.
    - Export the visual as an image for pasting into PowerPoint slide or other application.
